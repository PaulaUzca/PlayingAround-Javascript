# PlayingAround-Javascript
Playing around with javascript and writing some useful functions

- **automate.html** is a quick html page to generate a html list item that contains info for an article publication. With JavaScript, specifically using regex expressions. The user types in the link to the pdf file and the articles title. And the list items is generated automatically :D

- **tildes.html** have you ever copied a text from a PDF file. But you get a text where the accents are a little messed up. Something like this ´a e´ o´ ...and so on. Well this little scrip I wrote takes a text and fixes all the accents so there's no need to spend time correcting word by word ;)
